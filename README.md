# Tessa's book corner

Welcome, reader! This is a simple website where I can keep track of the books I've read. 
It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build), and uses [TinaCMS](https://tina.io) to edit the content. I built this site based on [Cassidy's blog template](https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg). Thanks, Cassidy!

## See the site

[TBD]

## Run it yourself

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                          | Action                                                        |
|:---------------------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`                    | Installs dependencies                                         |
| `npm run start`                  | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`                   |
| `npm run build`                  | Build your production site to `./dist/`                       |
| `npm run preview`                | Preview your build locally, before deploying                  |

You go to `localhost:4321/admin/index.html` to view the app.
